Code for assignment based on the nanogpt-lecture (see details below).

A sample melody dataset is provided in a separate archive 'finalAssignment_musicDataset'
and is names 'inputMelodiesAugmented.txt'.

Code created in the [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) video lecture series, specifically on the first lecture on nanoGPT. Publishing here as a Github repo so people can easily hack it, walk through the `git log` history of it, etc.
